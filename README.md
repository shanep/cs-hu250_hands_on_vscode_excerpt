# Visual Studio Code - Open Source

[VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) is a new choice of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

The [`vscode`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository is where we do development and there are many ways you can particpate in the project, for example:

* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) and help us verify as they are checked in
* Review [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pulls)
* Review the [documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs) and make pull requests for anything from typos to new content

## Contributing
If you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see the document [How to Contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute), which covers the following:

## Related Projects
Many of the core components and extensions to Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [loader](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loader), the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug), the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug).

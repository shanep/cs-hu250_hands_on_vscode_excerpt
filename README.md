# Code

Code is a new choice in developer tools, one that combines the
the simplicity and streamlined experience of a code editor with

Code is the heart of [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com),
the first code editor and first cross-platform development tool in the
Visual Studio family.
